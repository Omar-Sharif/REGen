I want to combat depression and CFS (chronic fatigue) naturally. So I\u2019ve been back on my subs for maybe 2 1/2 weeks, same with vyvanse. Is that enough time for my body to be dependent again? I want off this shit. \nComment: The subs are just putting off physical WD so yes you are dependent the same as if you took another opioid, like H/fentadope, to relieve symptoms. Except WD from subs is longer and less intense.",

I am having my wisdom teeth taken out on Friday and they are giving me laughing gas for the procedure. Do I need to change anything for the surgery and then for the pain after? If I recall correctly, straight buprenorphine doesn't block the opiates, but the nalaxone found in suboxone does. So I should be fine, correct? And then does anyone know if buprenorphine and laughing gas have any sort of reaction to one another? I'm a bitch when it comes to pain and I certainly don't want to feel any part of this surgery. \nComment: I asked for nitrous during a painful root canal procedure. I was really high on it. Also, don't drink a lot of coffee or tea before the procedure. I had three cups. Barely made it into the bathroom at my dentists office after the procedure! Was so out of it that I didn't realize how full my bladder was until they cut off the gas! Have been on buprenorphine for quite awhile. I used nitrous in the past before being on bup. I definitely felt much higher in the dentist chair than at the Dead show with the balloons. I almost asked the dental tech to reduce the gas rate once or twice...Was almost too high, don't yah know?! \ud83d\ude43 fare thee well!",

I started like this because I was afraid to take it all in one shot in the beginning. And then I have stuck with it since then. I have already decreased my does from 16 to 6mg film and I\u2019m stabilizing until September. But I\u2019m still dosing 4 times a day I feel fine, but I just want to make sure because I have other issues too. Should I just take away a dose for my next drop down? I know it\u2019s hard to stop this type of schedule because my body/brain is used to it. TIA. \nComment: For your next taper, I'd just cut out either your last dose, or one of your afternoon doses. I'd stay with the morning dose. Ideally you'd dose once per day to help break those addictive behaviors. However, there's generally no harm by dosing throughout the day.",

But the thing you have to determine is if taking suboxone actually makes you feel better, seems like what you\u2019re describing is that even right after dosing you still feel anxious. That\u2019s what happened to me I felt like shit when coming off but taking more suboxone didn\u2019t work inexplicably. So if you don\u2019t feel better when dosing I\u2019d say you might want to attempt to get off entirely and eventually you should even out.

Should I take more ? \nComment: Sorry you\u2019re going through that, when I got off sublocade I had crazy anxiety for like three plus months. But the thing you have to determine is if taking suboxone actually makes you feel better, seems like what you\u2019re describing is that even right after dosing you still feel anxious. That\u2019s what happened to me I felt like shit when coming off but taking more suboxone didn\u2019t work inexplicably. So if you don\u2019t feel better when dosing I\u2019d say you might want to attempt to get off entirely and eventually you should even out. I think that even if more suboxone doesn\u2019t make you feel better it\u2019s still probably related to suboxone one way or another.",

Thanks I know it was dumb and I honestly had to learn it this way . \nComment: Hi op One thing you have to remember right now is your not a idiot and it's part of addiction/ addictive personality like example I'm on subs too and Ive relapse probably 15 times in the space of 6 months. If I were you I would personally stick to the subs and chuck out the oxy or have a two/three. Days off Suboxone and that's gives you plenty of time to use the oxys if you want Don't call yourself a idiot as long as you can get in the right track and do everything right it's a win win. Look after yourself and wishing you the best",
        "post": "Help please. I\u2019ve been stabilized on Suboxone for 6 months and dealing with allot of health issues . I\u2019ve had an old script of real oxy 30s and I sniffed one this morning and skipped my dose cause I wasn\u2019t mentally well or strong enough to just toss them out . Obviously I didn\u2019t feel anything from the oxycodone and want to take my sub now that that\u2019s out of the way but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll throw myself into withdrawal ? If I\u2019ve been on subs for months and did 1 oxy 30 this one time can I still dose subs today or should i wait till tomorrow morning ? Thanks I know it was dumb and I honestly had to learn it this way .",

If I stop taking suboxone on day 7 will I still have withdraws from the fent press pills? If I need to take suboxone longer to keep me out of withdraws from the fent press pills will I be hooked on suboxone? \nComment: My advice? Don\u2019t worry about getting hooked on subs. Right now, you are taking fentanyl, which is a drug that can kill you. Relapse rates are very high when people, especially taking a drug like fentanyl, attempt a rapid taper. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be done, but but your risk of relapse is going to be much higher. I would recommend stabilizing on a dose for a few weeks at least, and then talk to your doctor about reducing. There\u2019s no way to get out of it without any withdrawal unfortunately.",

If I stop taking suboxone on day 7 will I still have withdraws from the fent press pills? If I need to take suboxone longer to keep me out of withdraws from the fent press pills will I be hooked on suboxone? \nComment: My advice? Don\u2019t worry about getting hooked on subs. Right now, you are taking fentanyl, which is a drug that can kill you. Relapse rates are very high when people, especially taking a drug like fentanyl, attempt a rapid taper. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be done, but but your risk of relapse is going to be much higher. I would recommend stabilizing on a dose for a few weeks at least, and then talk to your doctor about reducing. There\u2019s no way to get out of it without any withdrawal unfortunately.",

If I stop taking suboxone on day 7 will I still have withdraws from the fent press pills? If I need to take suboxone longer to keep me out of withdraws from the fent press pills will I be hooked on suboxone? \nComment: My advice? Don\u2019t worry about getting hooked on subs. Right now, you are taking fentanyl, which is a drug that can kill you. Relapse rates are very high when people, especially taking a drug like fentanyl, attempt a rapid taper. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t be done, but but your risk of relapse is going to be much higher. I would recommend stabilizing on a dose for a few weeks at least, and then talk to your doctor about reducing. There\u2019s no way to get out of it without any withdrawal unfortunately.",

I\u2019ve been completely off subs for about two weeks now and still have a ton of symptoms like fatigue, weakness, cold sweats, chills, night sweats, nausea, headaches and depression. I understand the depression can last quite some time but are the other symptoms normal after 2 weeks off. I did not come off cold Turkey, I reduced over time to .25mg and then jumped off. Is this normal? If so, how long can I expect to feel this way? The chills and night sweats are particularly bad. \nComment: It sounds like the bad end of normal for being down to .25 when you jumped. It ought to get better any day now IMO.",

I\u2019ve been completely off subs for about two weeks now and still have a ton of symptoms like fatigue, weakness, cold sweats, chills, night sweats, nausea, headaches and depression. I understand the depression can last quite some time but are the other symptoms normal after 2 weeks off. I did not come off cold Turkey, I reduced over time to .25mg and then jumped off. Is this normal? If so, how long can I expect to feel this way? The chills and night sweats are particularly bad. \nComment: It sounds like the bad end of normal for being down to .25 when you jumped. It ought to get better any day now IMO.",
