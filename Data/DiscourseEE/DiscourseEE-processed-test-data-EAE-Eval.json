You could maybe try timing your dose a bit later, so you dont wake you with withdrawals. I found splitting the dose 12 hrs apart to help as well, but I waited till I got very low to do that",

I've snorted my subs plenty, and you get a higher bioavailability and catch a lil buzz, but the naloxone doesn't even apply. I think this may be a good way to taper when you get down below 0.5mg a day, but using 4mg intranasal is gonna cause some problems down the road. For one, sub is super acidic.

(22, Male, 110/115lbs.) \nComment: I got off the blues a year ago and did the Bernese Method. Start with a super small dose of Subs like smaller than .5mg or 1/16 of a 8mg strip. Slowly increase the Subs daily. Once you are at 16mg per day on subs, you technically can't get high off of the blues so you will stop the blues at this point and then slowly taper off of the Subs. Take 10-14 days to get up to 16mg per day. If you start with too much Sub dose you will start sweating and go into WDs. Good luck!",

        "context": "Post: When to induct?. Was on 8 mg suboxone daily for a year. Last suboxone use was about 5 days ago, used about a gram of fent over 3 days. Knowing what i do about fent analogues, i bridged the gap for 24 hours with 4 15 mg percs (pharma) to make the first 24 hours bearable. So ive been off fent for 26 hours, and took my last 15 mg about an hour ago. when should i start to take subs? \nComment: That's kinda a tricky one imo.

From my understanding you'd have to be physically dependent on oxycodone to go into PWD after taking Suboxone. Since you took subs yesterday (I think) it was still on your receptors and at least partially blocking the oxy, so I don't think ripping oxy off the receptors is going to be any big deal. You could hedge your bets by taking 1 mg or even less of subs and seeing how you feel before taking the other 1 mg or whatever. Are you SURE it was pharma oxy?

I tried taking 6mg with just a 2mg tolerance and I didn\u2019t feel anything more but when I stay at 2mg and sometimes take them both in a day but spaced out a lot, it works better and I feel kinda warm and fuzzy like I can feel it like Kratom. \nComment: I'm on it for addiction.

I tried taking 6mg with just a 2mg tolerance and I didn\u2019t feel anything more but when I stay at 2mg and sometimes take them both in a day but spaced out a lot, it works better and I feel kinda warm and fuzzy like I can feel it like Kratom. \nComment: I'm on it for addiction. I had spinal fusion, denied pain management afterwards, , found oxycodone on the streets for 5 months, , failed 7 day subutex detox,, got on suboxone after trying detox. Here I sit after 7 mos suboxone treatment,,no relapses. I made a bad mistake, had 11 years in AA. I just want my abstinence back.",

BUT, it is possible to taper off fentanyl at the same time as consuming suboxone. it\u2019s called \u201cthe bernese method\u201d i suggest you look it up. it was the only thing that worked for me. it was too much to cold turkey it for 3 mf days before i got any relief. hopefully this works for you. cheers to getting clean and living a better life",

That being said the 72hr time in your edit is a good general window. Another factor is what opioid you are using, as some stronger meds might break through.",

I\u2019ve looked all over Reddit but what I can see Suboxone will not throw a person into precipitated withdrawal even if they start the Suboxone an hour after they dose kratom could someone knowledgeable tell me \nComment: Please don't do this. I was on Kratom for over a year and was doing anywhere between 22-30 grams a day and quit cold Turkey. The withdrawals weren't bad at all compared to other opiates. I'm on subs now because I eventually relapsed for a year on h and fent but if I could go back in time I never would of gotten on subs. Imo it's just trading one addiction for the other. Just tuff it out for a few days it will be better in the long run trust me",

I have been on suboxone since August of 2021 and I screwed up bad a few weeks ago and have been doing oxy 30s but I'm pretty positive they're fakes/fentanyl. I am trying to get back off of the oxy and just take the subs but they're not working at all. All of my normal withdrawal symptoms are still present even after taking my full dose of 22mg for the day. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience after relapse and if so, did the suboxone ever start working properly again or am I screwed?

I have been on suboxone since August of 2021 and I screwed up bad a few weeks ago and have been doing oxy 30s but I'm pretty positive they're fakes/fentanyl. I am trying to get back off of the oxy and just take the subs but they're not working at all. All of my normal withdrawal symptoms are still present even after taking my full dose of 22mg for the day. I'm wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience after relapse and if so, did the suboxone ever start working properly again or am I screwed? I'm scared to reach out to my doctor because I fear he will drop me. \nComment: Going to subs from fentanyl/fentanyl analogues can be trickier than with regular opioids. Look up the Bernese method for switching, a lot of people on here have found it effective. Otherwise you might have to endure a couple of days of WD before the subs work.",

And for the past year i get up all night usually about every hour, wide awake. I get up go for a smoke and then fall back asleep for another hour just to wake up again and do it all over again. But yesterday, I only took 1 film in the morning instead of 2, and it\u2019s the first time in a year that i slept through the night. Even slept past 6am for the first time in years. Now my question is, did I sleep better because I took less medicine? Is the 16mg a day causing irregular sleep patterns? If anybody els experienced this please comment. THANKS! \nComment: Yes.

God Bless. \nComment: For IR pharma pills, there\u2019s really no risk of PWD after 8-12 hours. It\u2019s easy to take your last dose before bed, sleep in as long as possible, wake up in withdrawals and induce subs. As for the balancing act of doing so daily, as much as it sucks you\u2019re really just going to confuse the shit outta your brain for very little pain relief. Sure it can be done, but you\u2019ll likely be stressed every morning and as the subs build in your body it\u2019ll just be a waste of oxy.",

Can I use Buprenorphine only (subutex) for the Bernese method or does it have to be burp/naltrexone (Suboxone) ?? I only have 24 mg of Suboxone left and 78 mg of subutex so I won\u2019t be able to do a full micro induction of 7-8 days with only 24 mg of suboxone. Wondering if I can start with Suboxone and switch to subutex or if I should just start with subutex and use it the whole time to get me stable on subutex and off fent?!? Make sense?? Wondering what the diff between Suboxone and subutex and which one is best for Bernese method microdosing subs to get off street fent. Please help!? Starting tomorrow!!! \nComment: Always stay on suboxone so you can cut films not pills to taper",

My wife and I have been using about a half gram each a day for the past 3 months. We have 14 8mg subs and a 6 day weekend coming up. Do we stand a chance of quitting? I'm just looking for some advice I guess. Feeling hopeless but we want to stop more than anything. Jobs and bills have gotten in the way of us detoxing for to long. We have to quit. This is our last chance before our lives get really really bad. \nComment: I just got my 5th shot today and have been trying to find info on this all day. This time the shot hurt Extremely bad. I usually think its mild. And usually there is a lump of the medicine at the injection site (lower stomach). But no lump at all today except thin tendrils going about 3 inches above and below coupled with pain. The lower ones definitely go to my groin. Idk if he went too deep or what. Last time this doc did it too close to the skin and I had really sticky substance leak out, I'm imagining it was some medicine and it got super bruised. It got better but this time I'm kinda freaked out",
